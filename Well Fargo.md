Hello, Mr. Shockley thank you for calling Wells Fargo Credit Card Services, my name is Mary How may I help you today?

## Customer

I’m calling about my Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Card. I was supposed to have a 0% interest on balance transfers for the first 15 months but I transferred a balance recently from my CapOne account and am getting charged a 19% APR on the balance.

## Agent

I’m sorry to hear about your issue and i will be happy to help you! Can you please verify your credit card number so I can research the problem?

## Customer

My Credit Card # is 5500-1200-5500-1200

## Agent

Ok. I’m looking at it now and it appears that this transfer doesn’t qualify for the promotion because you executed a balance transfer 6 months ago on your Wells Fargo Platinum Card and received the 0% introductory rate. Because you received this benefit already and it isn’t outside of the 15 month eligibility period, it doesn’t qualify for the 0% rate.

## Customer

Are you kidding me? I don't recall there being a 15 month waiting period. I've been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years and this is not the way I expect to be treated.

## Agent

I understand your frustration and your business is very important to us  It's obvious that you have been a loyal clinet of Wells Fargo so I would like honor the 0% promotonal rate for your balance transfer as a one-time exception. Would that resolve the issue for you?

## Customer

Yes, that would be great. I truly appritiate you working with me on this!

## Agent

Absolutly! I'm happy to help and glad we were able to resolve your issue.

## Customer

Ok, I just got it confirmed.

## Agent

Excellent thank you, I do see that you have successfully confirmed. You will see the change reflected in your next billing statement. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

## Customer

No thats all, thank you very much, you've been great!

## Agent

My pleasure and thank you for being a Wells Fargo customer. Have a great day!
