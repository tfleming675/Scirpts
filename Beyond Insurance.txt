Hello, thank you for calling Beyond Insurance. Is this a new or existing claim?

Customer 
I can barely hear you, can you speak up. I am having a hard time hearing you. 

Agent 
Absolutely, is this any better?

Customer
Yes, that is better, my name is Don Smith. I am calling for an existing claimá

Agent
I see, what is your case number?

Customer
My case number is 123456

Agent
This is the short-term disability claim correct?

Customer
Yes, that is the one. 

Agent
Ok, I found your case. I see that you are currently taking a prescription on Valindaium.ÊHave you been taking it twice per day as prescribed by your doctor?

Customer
No, actually I stopped taking it a couple days ago because it was making me anxious. Now I am feeling really tired and depressed.

Agent
What? Are you crazy? You canÕt just stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor.

Customer
I know but I just didnÕt feel like myself. What do you think I should do?

Agent
You need to talk to a doctor.Ê I will transfer you now.

Customer
Wait! I am confused. 

Agent
I bet you are! You should know better than to stop taking your meds. You need to listen to me!

Customer
How is this related to my insurance claim? Maybe I should speak to a supervisor. 

Agent 
I am sorry, there are no supervisors available due to the virus. 

Customer
{Get mad } 

Can you please have someone call me back as soon as possible.
