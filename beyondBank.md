Hi Joe. This is Mark Jones and I'm calling to dispute a transaction on my account.

Thank you Mr. Jones. I can help you with that. Can you verify the last six digits of your account number?
 
## Customer
Yes, its 769056
 
## Agent
Great, now which transaction would you like to discuss?
 
## Customer
The one on November 18th for $345.00 at Electronics Warehouse?
 
## Agent
Yes, I see it. You're saying you didn't make this purchase?
 
## Customer
No. I have never been to that store. I don't even know where it is.
 
## Agent
Ok, I am concerned you may be a victim of identify theft.

Let me finish this dispute and then I'll take care of cancelling the card and issuing you a new one. In order to dispute the charge, I need you to attest to the following statement: "I did not authorize the above mentioned transaction and I agree to it being investigated for compelling evidence. In case of finding a perpetrator, I agree to them being prosecuted for fraud.”
 
## Customer
Ok, I agree. 
 
## Agent
Alright. I've disputed the charge. Your record number is 7-6-2-3-4. 
 
## Customer
Ok, thank you this is very helpful.
