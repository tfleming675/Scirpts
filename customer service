Hello this is Customer Service. How can I help you?

Customer
Hello. I arrived at my hotel, but there is a lot of construction in the lobby and no rooms with a view available. 
Can you help?

Agent
Ok. Perhaps I can interest you in a two star hotel down the street. They don’t seem to be under construction and have an outdoor swimming pool.

Customer
My wife will not be interested in staying at a two star hotel, so I don't really think that is going to help. We paid for a luxury hotel. Is there anything else that you can do?

Agent
Let me check. Please hold... It appears that the two star hotel is the only lodging in your price range at this time. I went ahead and booked that hotel.

Customer
This is outrageous! I paid for a luxury vacation and now you want to book me in a terrible location. This is the last time I use your vacation service.

Agent
I'm really sorry that you feel this way. But there is nothing more I can do for you. I’ve booked that two star hotel for you. Have I assisted you with all your issues today?

Customer
No. I’m not very happy about this. This has ruined our vacation.

Customer
I would like to speak to a supervisor 

Agent
I am sorry there are no supervisors available right now due to the virus. We are all working from home.  

Customer
This is crazy, you need to do better than this!

Agent
OK. Thank you for calling.
