## Agent 
Hello, thank you for calling Beyond Cable Co. consumer support , how can I help you today?
 
## Customer

 Hello, I would like to cancel my account.
 
## Agent:
 Ok, I can help you. May I ask who is calling?
 
## Customer:
 
My name is Lisa Smith and I signed up for information on the free year of FiOptics Premium, but I never received anything. 
 
My friends got theirs set up, and It’s very frustrating that I took the time to sign up and you guys never followed through. I did not get a call about setting up my new service. 
 
## Agent
 I apologize for the inconvenience, but I will be more than happy to get all the information you need. 
 
May I ask what account number you used?
 
## Customer

I can barely hear you, can you speak up. I am having a hard time hearing you. 

## Agent 
Absolutely, is this any better?
 
## Customer  
Yes, thank you. My account number is 123456.
 
## Agent 
Thank you! -  One moment while I look up your account information.
  
	Thank you for your patience! 
 
	It looks like you are currently on our FIOPTICS Essential plan, which makes you ineligible for this offer.  
               
## Customer
What, this is outrageous, why was I not told about this when I signed up? I need to speak to a supervisor. 
 
## Agent 
I am sorry, there are no supervisors available due to the virus. We are working from home. 
 
## Customer
 {say good by and hang up}
