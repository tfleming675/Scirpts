  Sure. I would love to help you sir. Where would you like to go?
	
###  Customer
  I'm in San Francisco and I'd like to go to Las Vegas.

###  **Agent**
  And is this one way or round trip

###  Customer
  Round trip.

###  **Agent**
  When would you like to depart?

###  Customer
	On Saturday. Returning on the following Tuesday.

###  **Agent**
  OK. One moment please. What class would you like?

###  Customer
	Business Select please
	
###  **Agent**
  OK. We have a flight leaving Saturday morning and returning Tuesday afternoon for $900.
	
###  Customer
Wow thats outrageous!. I was hoping to find something cheaper. My dates are flexible. Do you think you could find me a cheaper flight on different days?

###  **Agent**
  I am so sorry about that. Let me check. There's another flight leaving Saturday night and returning on Tuesday morning for $500. 

###  Customer
	Thats much better

###  **Agent**
  There is a layover in New York.
	
###  Customer
  Hmmm... Is that the best that you can do?

###  **Agent**
  I'm afraid so. If you'd like i can reserve your seat now and you can pay later.

###  Customer
	That would be great. Thank you for your help. You were amazing.

###  **Agent**
That's my job! Have a great day!
