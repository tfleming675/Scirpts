 Hello this is customer service. How can I help you?

 ## Customer
 Hello. We have arrived at the resort, but there is a lot of construction in the lobby and our unit is not what we expected. Can you help?

 ## Agent
 Absolutely, I understand and I am more than happy to look into this for you. Can I get your member number. 

 ## Customer
 My number is 123456

 ## Agent
 Ok, I found your reservation and see your unit is also under renovation. 

 ## Customer
 What, this is outrageous why were we not told this before we spent 6 hours on a plane to get here.  We should have booked with our Marriot unit. 

 ## Agent
 Ok, but you should know better to just show up at a resort before calling! Perhaps I can interest you in a two star hotel down the street. They don’t seem to be under construction.

 ## Customer
 What? I would like to speak to a supervisor please. 

 ## Agent 
I am sorry, there are no supervisors available due to the virus. 

 ## Customer
 We are not interested in staying at a two star hotel, so i don't think that is going to help. We paid for our unit and want our unit! Is there anything that you can do?

 ## Agent
 I'm really sorry that you feel this way. I’ve just been authorized to offer you an upgraded unit on a higher floor with an ocean view. Due to the problems with your original unit, you won’t have any additional cost for this upgrade. Can I go ahead and confirm this for you?

 ## Customer
 Well, that’s more like it!
