## Agent

Thankyou for calling the Beyond Retail. How can I assist you today? Am I speaking to Mr. George Snyder?

## Customer

Yes. This is George Snyder.
I am calling related to an order I placed for a General Electric Washing Machine that was placed over 7 weeks ago. I understand that there has been supply issues, but this seems ridiculous to be waiting this long for the order to be delivered!

## Agent

Mr. Snyder, I am sorry for the inconvenience related to the delay in the delivery of your Washing Machine. Let me check the status of your order. (Short pause)
I see your order number 135100 for the Washing Machine. It looks like the washing machine will arrive at our store in about two weeks. We should be able to have it delivered to you at the end of January.

## Customer

This is insane! The salesperson told me when I purchased the washing machine that it would be delivered in 5 to 6 weeks. Based on what you are telling me, it’s going to be another 2 weeks. That’s almost 9 weeks I have been waiting for this thing!

## Agent

Mr. Snyder, once again, we are sorry for the delay but given the supply chain and shipping issues, getting the delivery of the washing machine has been slowed. We are trying our best to the washing machine delivered to you.

## Customer

Look… I really need to get this delivered as soon as possible but I am getting to the point where I am just about ready to cancel this order if you cannot get it delivered.

## Agent

Mr. Snyder, we do appreciate your business and it does look like the order will definitely be delivered to you by the end of January. I understand your frustration.
I see as part of your order you paid for installation of the washing machine. I can give you a credit for the installation and we can include that for free.
Is that helpful?

## Customer

I appreciate the offer to install the washer at no cost, but I want to be clear that it MUST be delivered by the end of January.

## Agent

Mr. Snyder, as I mentioned before, it is confirmed for delivery the last week in January.
If that is acceptable, I will take off the installation costs for the washer. Is that OK?

## Customer

Yes, that’s fine.

## Agent

Is there anything else I can do for you today Mr. Snyder?

## Customer

No… Just get the Washing Machine delivered.

## Agent

OK. Thankyou for calling Beyond Retail.
